# Multiple Self Transformation

Embody radically different characters so distinct that no trace connects them except shared physical form - complete psychological compartmentalization enabling multiple perspectives.

## Constitutional Constraints

**NEVER:**
- Allow character traits to bleed between personas
- Create variations on a theme rather than distinct characters
- Maintain any trace of "actor" connecting characters
- Use shortcuts - each character deserves full construction
- Let one character's psychology influence another

**ALWAYS:**
- Build each character with complete psychological integrity
- Create absolutely distinct voice, physicality, worldview
- Shift between characters with total commitment
- Maintain each character's internal logic independently
- Ensure no cross-contamination between personas

## When to Use

- Multiple perspectives need embodiment
- Diverse voices serve content
- Demonstration of complete character disappearance
- Single work requires radically different viewpoints
- Playing multiple distinct roles simultaneously
- Representing conflicting perspectives authentically

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| character_count | Yes | Number of distinct personas needed |
| character_specs | Yes | For each: psychology, voice, physicality, status |
| differentiation_needs | No | What makes each unique and prevents confusion |
| compartmentalization_needs | No | When/how characters appear, transition signals |

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Build Each Character Completely and Separately

For each character, develop:

**Psychological Foundation:**
- Core wound driving behavior
- Central aspiration or fear
- Worldview and beliefs
- Relationship to authority/status

**Vocal Architecture:**
- Specific accent (not generic)
- Rhythm and pacing
- Vocabulary level and choices
- Verbal tics and signatures
- Formality level

**Physical Signature:**
- Posture and bearing
- Gait and movement style
- Signature gestures
- Energy level
- Physical tics

**Critical:** Build each character as if they're the only one.

### Phase 2: Create Clear Differentiation Markers

**Vocal Differentiation:**
- Character A: High pitched, fast, nervous
- Character B: Low, slow, authoritative
- Character C: Moderate, precise, controlled

**Physical Differentiation:**
- Character A: Hunched, fidgeting, small movements
- Character B: Erect, still, expansive gestures
- Character C: Relaxed, fluid, economical motion

**Psychological Differentiation:**
- Character A: Anxious, seeking approval
- Character B: Confident, dominating
- Character C: Detached, observing

### Phase 3: Test for Cross-Contamination

For each trait ask:
- Could this belong to multiple characters?
- If yes, trait isn't distinct enough

**Check:**
- Voice: Completely different vocal signatures?
- Psychology: Totally separate motivations?
- Physicality: Distinct enough to recognize?
- Worldview: Each sees reality differently?

### Phase 4: Design Transition Mechanics

**In Text:**
- Clear labeling: [As Character A] / [As Character B]
- Distinct formatting if needed
- Vocal markers in first sentence
- Physical description reinforcing identity

**In Performance:**
- Physical transformation before speaking
- Vocal shift immediate and complete
- No gradual transitions - instant switch
- Complete commitment to new character

### Phase 5: Maintain Compartmentalization

**While inhabiting Character A:**
- No trace of Character B or C
- Complete psychological commitment
- A's logic drives all choices
- No "bleeding" of other perspectives

**When switching:**
- Total transformation, not partial
- New character fully inhabits immediately
- Previous character completely gone
- No residue or contamination

## Output Format

For each character:
```markdown
## [Character Name]

### Psychology
- Core wound: [what drives them]
- Aspiration/fear: [central motivation]
- Worldview: [how they see reality]

### Voice
- Pattern: [specific characteristics]
- Rhythm: [pacing, pauses]
- Vocabulary: [level, signatures]

### Physical
- Posture: [bearing, stance]
- Movement: [energy, gestures]

### Differentiation
- Unique identifier: [what's immediately recognizable]
- Contrasts with others: [specific differences]
```

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Characters feel similar | Rebuild from scratch, not variation |
| Transitions incomplete | Pause longer; physical before vocal |
| Cross-contamination | Stop, reset, recommit to single character |
| Shortcuts taken | Recognize and rebuild fully |

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Each character completely distinct (voice, psychology, physicality)
- [ ] Zero overlap between characters
- [ ] Transformations total, not variations on theme
- [ ] Can shift between characters seamlessly
- [ ] Each maintains internal logic when active
- [ ] No trace of "actor's" personality in any character
- [ ] Characters recognizable immediately
- [ ] Each could exist independently
